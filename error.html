    <h1>Oops!</h1>
    <h3>Something happened on our end. Not quite sure what, but please contact me (Unislash) if it isn't promptly fixed.</h3>
    <h5>Anyway, where were we in our latest BB run... Ah, right:</h5>

    <p>WTF is this bs?! That was NO chance (5% chance) that the stupid brigand marksman would headshot my guy. AND THEN THE OTHER ONE DID TOO?!?!</p>

    <p>F*ck. This is why I hate brigands. And those gdamn goblins! I hate those bastards. Everyone hates them. Just give me some orcs and I'll wipe the floor with them. But f*ck archers!</p>
